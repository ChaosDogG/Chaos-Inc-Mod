The Story:
<br>
The world you explore seems to be as you last left it, yet something is amiss. Suddenly, you're surrounded by creatures that give you quite the fright, yet they look at you without a single care. The local rivers also seem to be full of errors, and villages appear to be studying these strange happenings. Whatever could this mean, and what caused it? Are there more things to discover that have been fussed with? Explore the world and figure out the answers to these questions!

Description:
<br>
This mod is designed to be based off of my datapack of the same name, FrivyCat Inc Datapack. However, this is meant as a successor so any future additions will most likely happen here before the DP will receive them.
