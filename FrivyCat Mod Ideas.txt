Ideas to implement:
    Allow Killer Rabbits and Giants to spawn naturally
    Make some Knowledge Books in creative inventory have pre-made recipes like spawn eggs and tools
    Give Knowledge Books an easy-to-understand tooltip depicting the recipe it holds
    Add Illusioners to raids (last wave) and maybe the mansion or new structure
    Make Easter Egg spawn random baby mob then thrown similar to the egg

Currently in development:
    TOTAL 1.20.1 PORT!
    Mug of Honey same as Honey Bottle
    Liquid Filled Mugs are new Potion variants
    Mug is variant of Bottle

Will not/Cannot implement/Removed (and why):
    Pencil (Mojang alr beat me to the punch)
    Baby stuff (what sort of madness was I on to think these were fine to add?)
    Frivy Coins (no real reason for them, plenty of other currency mods)
    Lucky Heads/Mobs (not vibing with them anymore)
    Ladies (again, what the actual hell was I thinking with this?)

Fully implemented:
    Gems and Special Diamonds
    Unobtainable items in creative inventory
